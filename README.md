 # Migrate a UIKit Interface to SwiftUI 
 
 <p> This project helps you practice your iOS development skills by migrating an existing interface built with UIKit to SwiftUI. You'll also learn to manage source code with Git and GitHub for collaborative development. </p>
 
## Features

Migrate from UIKit to SwiftUI: Convert a UIKit-based interface into SwiftUI.
Interactive and modern UI: Create a sleek, interactive user experience using SwiftUI components.
Git and GitHub integration: Collaborate and manage the source code effectively using Git and GitHub.

Travel app functionality: Includes features such as:

Displaying a list of destinations.
Details of each destination.
Location of destinations.

## Prerequisites

A macOS computer.
The latest version of Xcode, available for free on the App Store.
Familiarity with Swift and iOS development concepts.

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository
Open the project in Xcode using the .xcworkspace file.

## Usage

Explore the existing UIKit code to understand its structure.
Start migrating the interface to SwiftUI while retaining the core functionalities.
Test the app in the iOS simulator or on a physical device to ensure everything works.

UIKit Interface & SwiftUI Interface

## How it Works

The project starts with a UIKit-based app interface, which you'll gradually migrate to SwiftUI. As you move components, SwiftUIâ€™s declarative syntax will enable you to create a modern and interactive user interface.

Destination Display: Build a SwiftUI view to showcase the list of travel destinations.
Destination Details: Migrate the system for displaying destination details, enhancing it with SwiftUI's interactive capabilities.
Location: Integrate a feature to display the locations of destinations on a map.

## FAQs

Why migrate from UIKit to SwiftUI?

SwiftUI provides a more modern, declarative approach to building user interfaces. It simplifies UI creation and allows better integration with Swift.

What version of Xcode is required?

The latest version of Xcode is recommended to fully leverage SwiftUI features.

Is SwiftUI backward compatible with older iOS versions?

SwiftUI supports iOS 13 and later. For older devices, the app will need to retain some UIKit elements.

## Building

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository
cd project-directory
open Project.xcworkspace
Tip: Make sure you are using the latest Swift and SwiftUI features by keeping Xcode updated.
