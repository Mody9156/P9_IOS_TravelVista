How it Works
The project starts with a UIKit-based app interface, which you'll gradually migrate to SwiftUI. As you move components, SwiftUIâ€™s declarative syntax will enable you to create a modern and interactive user interface.

Menu Display: Build a SwiftUI view to showcase the restaurant's menu.
Reservations: Migrate the reservation system, improving it with SwiftUI's interactive capabilities.

FAQs
Why migrate from UIKit to SwiftUI?

SwiftUI provides a more modern, declarative approach to building user interfaces. It simplifies UI creation and allows better integration with Swift.

What version of Xcode is required?

The latest version of Xcode is recommended to fully leverage SwiftUI features.

Is SwiftUI backward compatible with older iOS versions?

SwiftUI supports iOS 13 and later. For older devices, the app will need to retain some UIKit elements.

Building
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository
cd project-directory
open Project.xcworkspace
Tip: Make sure you are using the latest Swift and SwiftUI features by keeping Xcode updated.
